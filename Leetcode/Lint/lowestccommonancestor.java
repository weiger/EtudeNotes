/*
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

Example
        4

    /     \

  3         7

          /     \

        5         6

For 3 and 5, the LCA is 4.

For 5 and 6, the LCA is 7.

For 6 and 7, the LCA is 7.
